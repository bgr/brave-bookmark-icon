# Just a Bookmark Icon - extension for Brave Browser

This is for those who are switching from Chrome to Brave and are desperately
missing the :star: icon on the right of the address bar.

### Known issues

* Clicking the button doesn't open the bookmarks menu - this is "by design"
  (meaning, I don't know how to implement this). I'm happy to accept a PR for
  this.

* Star doesn't update - I've noticed this only once, so it should be super
  rare, and gets fixed by changing to another tab and coming back.
