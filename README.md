# Just a Bookmark Icon - extension for Brave Browser

This is for those who are switching from Chrome to Brave and are desperately
missing the :star: icon on the right of the address bar.

Looks like this in dark & light themes:

### How to install

 * [Download](https://github.com/bgr/brave-bookmark-icon/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip somewhere
 * In Brave Menu > Extensions enable "Developer mode" click "Load unpacked"
 * Navigate to where you unzipped it and select that folder

Once you've installed it, you can move it next to the address bar:

(note that the star turned out too red in the gif above, the actual color is
like in the first image above).

Best used with "Use wide address bar" enabled in settings.


### Known issues

Clicking the button doesn't open the bookmarks menu -- you'll have to use the
Brave's icon to bookmark a page (or use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>
keyboard shortcut).

This is "by design" (meaning, I don't know how to implement this). I'm happy to
accept a PR for this.

I've also noticed that very rarely the icon doesn't update, but it gets fixed
by switching to another tab and coming back.
